[敏捷软件开发方法论](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-agile-software-development/)是软件开发的一个过程(如其他软件开发方法论——瀑布模型、V 模型、迭代模型等。)，但是，敏捷开发模型也是一种增量模型。软件以递增的、快速的周期发展。在英语中，敏捷的意思是“快速轻松地行动的能力”和快速响应变化的能力——这是敏捷软件开发的一个重要方面。

**敏捷方法论的优势:**

1.  In agile methodology, the delivery of software is unremitting.
2.  Customers are satisfied because every Sprint working feature of the software is delivered to them.
3.  Customers can see the job characteristics that meet their expectations.
4.  If the customer has any feedback or changes to the function, it can be adjusted in the current version of the product.
5.  In agile methodology, business people and developers need daily interaction.
6.  In this methodology, attention is paid to the good design of products.
7.  Even in the later stage of development, the change of requirements is acceptable.
8.  Agile /Scrum method can improve organizational synergy by breaking organizational barriers and cultivating trust and cooperation spirit around organizational goals.

**敏捷方法的缺点:**

1.  In agile methods, there are fewer documents.
2.  Sometimes in agile methodology, the requirements are not very clear, so it is difficult to predict the expected results.
3.  In a few projects at the beginning of the software development life cycle, it is difficult to estimate the actual workload required.
4.  Because the functions are constantly evolving, there is always the risk that the project will last forever.
5.  For complex projects, it is difficult to estimate the resource requirements and efforts.
