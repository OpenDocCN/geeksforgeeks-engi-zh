**软件定义的存储:**

随着数据的生成呈指数级增长，存储数据和管理服务器变得更加昂贵和复杂。有几个系统可以帮助组织管理他们的数据。我们即将看到一个比传统系统更高效的系统。这就是软件定义存储。

那么，让我们来理解**SDS 是什么意思，为什么它更好**。

*   Software-defined storage (SDS) is a way to virtually separate the storage software from its hardware. Storage software is a layer between physical storage and data requests, which helps you control storage requests. This means that we can control where and how data is stored.
*   SDS is usually designed to run on basic server hardware with Intel X86 processor, which can save cost compared with traditional system.

**为什么 SDS 比传统系统好？**

SDS 比传统系统更好，因为它实际上将存储软件从硬件中分离或抽象出来。这使您能够扩展存储容量，而不是添加另一个硬件。SDS 控制器软件提供连接、网络和存储访问设施。

让我们来看看 SDS 的关键特性。

1.  **Automation:** Reduce the manual process and operating cost through simple and efficient management.
2.  **Standard infrastructure:** To manage and maintain a large number of storage devices and software, an API is needed.
3.  **Scalability and transparency:** The ability to expand storage capacity and monitor its resource availability and cost estimation without degrading performance.

**软件定义存储的工作方式:**

这就是接下来要做的。SDS 从硬件中提取存储软件，并将所有存储软件和资源虚拟分组。这提供了一个由独立硬件组成的大型联合存储池。因此，您可以在其中的任何硬件上存储数据。它为您提供了根据需要升级或降级硬件的灵活性。

**SDS 的优势:**

*   flexibility
*   expandability
*   agility
*   automation
*   cost efficiency
*   Virtualization and interoperability

1.  **Flexibility:** SDS infrastructure can be built on commodity servers with X86 processors. Therefore, you don't have to worry about choosing SDS controllers of companies that don't buy hardware.
2.  **Scalability:** It is easier to add additional storage devices to the virtual pool, CPU and memory to improve performance and capacity.
3.  **Capability:** SDS can support both traditional and new generation applications.
4.  **Automation:** SDS can adapt to data and performance requirements without any manual operation by the administrator.
5.  **Cost efficiency:** Because SDS efficiently uses available resources and optimizes storage capacity. The automation of SDS reduces the operating cost through automated management.
6.  **Virtualization and interoperability: [T1】 SDS makes it possible to virtually integrate various storage resources and manage them as a single unit. It is feasible to integrate server hardware from different vendors through SDS, because it acts as a coordinator to unify different storage services and virtually put them in a pool.**

有了这些好处，SDS 可以成为组织智能管理和存储数据的游戏规则改变者。
