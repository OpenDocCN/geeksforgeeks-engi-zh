# 缺陷分析流程

**缺陷分析**不是取得成功的唯一关键，而是被认为是这些关键之一。[缺陷](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/what-is-defect)分析是一个过程，包括输入和单个缺陷，以及简单地通过分类、产品线、修订历史、产品线、涉及的团队等跨越缺陷。它基本上让团队更接近零缺陷的目标。

**缺陷分析**应该被认为是产生未来软件开发改进和成功的优先事项。缺陷分析的主要目标是分析缺陷，找出缺陷的根本原因，然后制定并采取措施或行动来最小化缺陷。缺陷分析通常借助于从先前发现的缺陷中学习和获得的知识来执行。

**缺陷分析流程:**

1.  Or identifying defects is the initial step in defect analysis.
2.  Defects being identified are analyzed by testers.
3.  After analysis, the main root causes of defects should be determined and clarified.
4.  After analyzing the root causes, various measures and actions should be taken and implemented to repair the main root causes of defects, so as to eliminate or minimize the recurrence of defects.
5.  After successful elimination, it is necessary to verify, that is, check or prove that the adopted measures actually prevent the recurrence of defects.

**缺陷分析流程的优势:**

*   Provide feedback to developers, because developers usually improve the quality and productivity of [software products](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-product/) .
*   By solving the defects, their influence can be prevented in other fields.
*   Defect analysis reduces the recurrence of defects, thus reducing the rework required to solve defects, re-inspection, cost required to solve defects, and cost caused by low [software quality](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-quality/) .
*   For better defect analysis, there should be proper communication among development team, test team and managers. Therefore, defect analysis can improve the communication between teams.
*   On the whole, the [software development life cycle (SDLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/) time has been improved. As the time required for rework is reduced or minimized, the process cycle time is increased and the recurrence of defects is prevented.
