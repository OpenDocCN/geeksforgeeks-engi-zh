# 帕累托图的优缺点

**[【帕累托图】](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-to-use-a-defect-pareto-chart/)** 基本上是一个统计图，按照出现频率(出现次数)及其累积影响的降序来表示重大缺陷或问题。累积影响仅仅是指由于人类过去、现在和未来的活动或自然过程的综合影响而导致的系统或项目的变化。帕累托分析被认为是一种强有力的质量和决策工具。我们可以在下面给出的各种情况下使用帕累托图:

*   If a person wants to organize and manage a large amount of information and data that need to be organized.
*   When someone wants to explain and tell the defects to stakeholders with higher priority.
*   When someone wants to prioritize defects or tasks according to their severity, that is, according to their impact on the system or organization.
*   When the analysis data or [defect](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/what-is-defect) is critical.

**优势:**

*   One of the essential and most important advantages of Pareto analysis is that it only helps to identify and determine the main cause, that is, the root cause of defects or problems.
*   First, the defects are sorted according to their severity, that is, in descending order. Organize defects from the highest priority to the lowest priority with the help of pareto chart. The highest priority defect is eliminated first or solved first.
*   With the help of pareto chart, the cumulative effect of defects can also be determined. In short, the cumulative effect is the effect caused by defects occurring for a long time.
*   Pareto chart also helps to better explain the defects that need to be solved first. People can also decide and plan the correct and important measures or actions to be taken for defects.
*   With the help of pareto chart, personal skills are also improved in better ways, such as problem-solving skills and decision-making skills. It just helps to improve the important skills needed, because when someone prepares for pareto chart, it can organize problems related to defects or anything into cohesive facts.
*   It also helps to solve problems related to problem solving and decision-making, time management (i.e., going to work on time or going to work personally), change management and so on.
*   People can use pareto chart to plan, analyze and solve problems or defects.

**劣势:**

*   One of the main disadvantages is that in Pareto analysis, root cause analysis cannot be completed by itself. There is a tool requirement, namely root cause analysis tool, which is used to determine or identify the root cause or main cause of defects.
*   Does not represent the severity of the defect or any problem. It only displays qualitative data.
*   Pareto analysis only focuses on the past data that have been damaged. Yes, past data is also essential, but it is not necessary to be relevant in future scenes. Therefore, it should pay attention to past data as well as present and future data.
*   Pareto analysis can not be applied to all cases. Only in certain cases.
*   There are other shortcomings, such as mistakes in grading and application.
