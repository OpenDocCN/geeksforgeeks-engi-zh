极限编程是敏捷模型中最重要的软件开发框架之一。它用于提高软件质量和响应客户需求。极限编程模型建议将过去在程序开发项目中运行良好的最佳实践发挥到极致。

**需要练习极限编程的良好实践:**极限编程模型中已被认可并建议最大限度地使用的一些良好实践如下:

*   **Code review:** Code review efficiently detects and corrects errors. It suggests pair programming, that is, a pair of programmers switch between them every hour to code and check the written code.
*   **Test:** Test code helps to eliminate errors and improve its reliability. XP recommends using test-driven development (TDD) to continuously write and execute test cases. In TDD method, test cases are written even before any code is written.
*   **Incremental development:** Incremental development is very good because of the feedback from customers. Based on this, the development team will come up with new increments every few days after each iteration.
*   **Simplicity:** Simplicity makes it easier to develop high-quality code and test and debug code.
*   **Design:** Good quality design is very important for developing a good quality software. Therefore, everyone should design every day.
*   **Integration test:** helps to identify bugs of different functional interfaces. Extreme Programming recommends that developers build and perform integration tests several times a day to achieve continuous integration.

**极限编程的基本原理:** XP 基于开发人员实现用户故事的频繁迭代。用户故事是客户关于所需功能的简单而非正式的陈述。用户故事是用户对所需系统功能的常规描述。它没有提到更精细的细节，例如可能发生的不同场景。在用户故事的基础上，项目团队提出了隐喻。隐喻是系统如何工作的共同愿景。开发团队可能会决定为某些特性构建一个 Spike。Spike 是一个非常简单的程序，旨在探索所提出的解决方案的适用性。可以认为它类似于原型。使用 XP 模型进行软件开发时遵循的一些基本活动如下:

*   **Coding:** The coding concept used in XP model is slightly different from traditional coding. Here, coding activities include drawing diagrams (modeling) to be converted into codes, writing web-based system scripts, and choosing among several alternative solutions.
*   **Testing:** XP model attaches great importance to testing, and thinks that testing is the primary factor in developing trouble-free software.
*   **Listen:** If developers want to develop a software with good quality, they need to listen carefully to customers' opinions. Sometimes programmers may not have in-depth knowledge of the system to be developed. Therefore, programmers need to correctly understand the functions of the system, and they must listen to customers' opinions.
*   **Design:** Without a proper design, the implementation of a system will become too complicated to understand the solution, thus making the maintenance cost expensive. Good design eliminates complex dependencies in the system. Therefore, it is emphasized that proper design should be used effectively.
*   **Feedback:** One of the most important aspects of XP mode is to get feedback to know the exact customer needs. Frequent contact with customers makes development effective.
*   **Simplicity:** The main principle of XP model is to develop a simple system that will work efficiently in the current time, instead of trying to build something that will take time and may never be used. It focuses on some specific features that are needed immediately, instead of spending time and energy speculating about future needs.

**极限编程(XP)的应用:**下面给出了一些适合使用 XP 模型开发的项目:

*   **Small projects:** XP model is very useful in small projects composed of small teams, because face-to-face meetings are easier to achieve.
*   **Projects or research projects involving new technologies:** These projects are faced with rapidly changing demands and technical problems. So use XP mode to complete this kind of project.
