这是 11 个步骤[软件测试](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/)过程是一种基于经验的解决测试任务的实用方法。

这些解释如下。

*   **Step-1: Assess Development Plan and Status –**
    This initiative may be prerequisite to putting together Verification, Validation, and Testing Plan wont to evaluate implemented software solution. During this step, testers challenge completeness and correctness of event plan. Based on extensiveness and completeness of Project Plan testers can estimate quantity of resources they’re going to got to test implemented software solution.

*   **Step-2: Develop the Test Plan –**
    Forming plan for testing will follow an equivalent pattern as any software planning process. The structure of all plans should be an equivalent, but content will vary supported degree of risk testers perceive as related to software being developed.
*   **Step-3: Test Software Requirements –**
    Incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent requirements cause most software failures. The inability to get requirement right during requirements gathering phase can also increase cost of implementation significantly. Testers, through verification, must determine that requirements are accurate, complete, and they do not conflict with another.
*   **Step-4: Test Software Design –**
    This step tests both external and internal design primarily through verification techniques. The testers are concerned that planning will achieve objectives of wants, also because design being effective and efficient on designated hardware.
*   **Step-5: Build Phase Testing –**
    The method chosen to build software from internal design document will determine type and extensiveness of testers needed. As the construction becomes more automated, less testing are going to be required during this phase. However, if software is made using waterfall process, it’s subject to error and will be verified. Experience has shown that it’s significantly cheaper to spot defects during development phase, than through dynamic testing during test execution step.

*   **Step-6: Execute and Record Result –**
    This involves testing of code during dynamic state. The approach, methods, and tools laid out in test plan are going to be wont to validate that executable code actually meets stated software requirements, and therefore the structural specifications of design.
*   **Step-7: Acceptance Test –**
    Acceptance testing enables users to gauge applicability and usefulness of software in performing their day-to-day job functions. This tests what user believes software should perform, as against what documented requirements state software should perform.
*   **Step-8: Report Test Results –**
    Test reporting is continuous process. It may be both oral and written. It is important that defects and concerns be reported to the appropriate parties as early as possible, so that corrections can be made at the lowest possible cost.
*   **Step-9: The Software Installation –**
    Once test team has confirmed that software is prepared for production use, power to execute that software during production environment should be tested. This tests interface to operating software, related software, and operating procedures.
*   **Step-10: Test Software Changes –**
    While this is often shown as Step 10, within context of performing maintenance after software is implemented, concept is additionally applicable to changes throughout implementation process. Whenever requirements changes, test plan must change, and impact of that change on software systems must be tested and evaluate.
*   **步骤-11:评估测试有效性–**
    测试改进最好通过在每个软件测试任务的顶部评估测试的有效性来实现。虽然这种评估主要由测试人员执行，但是如果 it 组织中存在功能，它应该涉及开发人员、软件用户和质量保证专业人员。
