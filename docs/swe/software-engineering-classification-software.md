该软件广泛应用于医院、银行、学校、国防、金融、股票市场等多个领域。它可以分为不同的类型:

### 在应用的基础上:

1.  **System Software –** 
    System Software is necessary to manage the computer resources and support the execution of application programs. Software like operating systems, compilers, editors and drivers, etc., come under this category. A computer cannot function without the presence of these. Operating systems are needed to link the machine-dependent needs of a program with the capabilities of the machine on which it runs. Compilers translate programs from high-level language to machine language. 
2.  **Networking and Web Applications Software –** 
    Networking Software provides the required support necessary for computers to interact with each other and with data storage facilities. The networking software is also used when software is running on a network of computers (such as the World Wide Web). It includes all network management software, server software, security and encryption software, and software to develop web-based applications like HTML, PHP, XML, etc. 
3.  **Embedded Software –** 
    This type of software is embedded into the hardware normally in the Read-Only Memory (ROM) as a part of a large system and is used to support certain functionality under the control conditions. Examples are software used in instrumentation and control applications like washing machines, satellites, microwaves, etc. 
4.  **Reservation Software –** 
    A Reservation system is primarily used to store and retrieve information and perform transactions related to air travel, car rental, hotels, or other activities. They also provide access to bus and railway reservations, although these are not always integrated with the main system. These are also used to relay computerized information for users in the hotel industry, making a reservation and ensuring that the hotel is not overbooked. 
5.  **Business Software –** 
    This category of software is used to support business applications and is the most widely used category of software. Examples are software for inventory management, accounts, banking, hospitals, schools, stock markets, etc. 
6.  **Entertainment Software –** 
    Education and entertainment software provides a powerful tool for educational agencies, especially those that deal with educating young children. There is a wide range of entertainment software such as computer games, educational games, translation software, mapping software, etc. 
7.  **Artificial Intelligence Software –** 
    Software like expert systems, decision support systems, pattern recognition software, artificial neural networks, etc. come under this category. They involve complex problems which are not affected by complex computations using non-numerical algorithms. 
8.  **Scientific Software –** 
    Scientific and engineering software satisfies the needs of a scientific or engineering user to perform enterprise-specific tasks. Such software is written for specific applications using principles, techniques, and formulae specific to that field. Examples are software like MATLAB, AUTOCAD, PSPICE, ORCAD, etc. 
9.  **Utilities Software –** 
    The programs coming under this category perform specific tasks and are different from other software in terms of size, cost, and complexity. Examples are anti-virus software, voice recognition software, compression programs, etc. 
10.  **文档管理软件–**
    文档管理软件用于跟踪、管理和存储文档，以减少文书工作。这种系统能够记录不同用户创建和修改的各种版本(历史跟踪)。它们通常提供存储、版本控制、元数据、安全性以及索引和检索功能。

### 在版权基础上:

1.  **商用–**
    它代表了我们从软件公司、商用电脑商店等购买的大部分软件。在这种情况下，当用户购买软件时，他们会获得一个许可证密钥来使用它。不允许用户复制软件。该程序的版权归公司所有。

2.  **Shareware –** 
    Shareware software is also covered under copyright but the purchasers are allowed to make and distribute copies with the condition that after testing the software, if the purchaser adopts it for use, then they must pay for it. 

    在上述两种类型的软件中，都不允许对软件进行更改。

3.  **Freeware –** 
    In general, according to freeware software licenses, copies of the software can be made both for archival and distribution purposes but here, distribution cannot be for making a profit. Derivative works and modifications to the software are allowed and encouraged. Decompiling of the program code is also allowed without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. 
4.  **公共领域–**
    在公共领域软件的情况下，原始版权所有者明确放弃软件的所有权利。因此，软件拷贝既可以用于存档，也可以用于分发，并且对分发没有限制。软件的修改和逆向工程也是允许的。
