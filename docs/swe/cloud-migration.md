在当今竞争激烈的商业世界中，云技术足以随时随地提供云服务。在当前这个时代，云计算不管我们喜不喜欢，但它就在这里，也将为我们和整个社会造福。它改进了经营商业活动的方式，降低了经营商业的成本，提高了生产率，并在一个过程中使人们的生活更加容易，而且它还在继续。

在我们使用云技术的地方，点云迁移就出现了。因此，让我们深入了解一下这种迁移概念，从而更好地了解这种云迁移。

**云迁移:**

云迁移是从旧的传统业务运营到数字业务运营的转变，这个过程是指将数字业务运营迁移到云。这意味着数据、应用程序或其他业务元素被转移到云计算环境中。例如，将数据和应用程序从本地内部数据中心移动到云中。

**内部向云迁移流程:**

从小型组织到大型组织，每个企业都遵循略有不同的云迁移流程。云迁移前考虑的一些常见因素有

*   Requirements and performance evaluation
*   Cloud provider selection
*   Operating cost calculation

基本步骤如下

*   Establish migration target
*   Create security policy
*   Copy existing database
*   Mobile business intelligence
*   Then switch production from the inside to the cloud.

**云迁移策略:**

5 R 代表云迁移策略。

1.  **rehost:** refers to bringing applications to the new hosted cloud environment by selecting [IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-iaas-paas-and-saas/)
2.  **Refactoring:** refers to reusing the application code and framework and running the application on [PAAs (platform as a service).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/)
3.  **Revision:** refers to extending the code base and then deploying it through rehosting or refactoring.
4.  **Rebuilding:** refers to re-constructing the application from scratch on the platform of PaaS provider.
5.  **Replacement:** refers to replacing the old application with the newly constructed [SaaS (software as a service).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-as-a-service-saas/)

**云迁移的好处:**

1.  **Scalability:** can be extended enough to support various workloads and users. Therefore, it can be expanded without affecting performance.
2.  **Performance:** Compared with traditional business processes, migrating to the cloud can provide higher performance and customer satisfaction.
3.  **Productivity:** Because of the complexity of its management infrastructure, the increased productivity is more focused on the growing business processes.
4.  **Flexibility:** You can use services flexibly, and you can also access cloud services anytime, anywhere according to your needs.
5.  **Cost:** Entering the cloud technology reduces the cost of managing, operating, upgrading and maintaining IT operations or infrastructure.
6.  **Security:** Security is the main concern of cloud service providers.
7.  **Profitability:** Because it follows the pay-per-use model, it provides customers with higher profitability.
8.  **Agility:** It is flexible enough to keep up with the rapid changes of technology and provide updates and advanced settings quickly according to the needs.
9.  **Recovery:** It provides backup and recovery solutions for enterprises with less time and upfront investment.

**云迁移挑战:**

1.  Moving the database is an arduous task, because it involves a large amount of data, and most of them are transmitted through the Internet.
2.  After the data is transferred to the cloud database, another problem is to check whether the transferred data is complete and safe, and whether there is any data loss in the process.
3.  During the migration process, there will be a problem, because some operations or data have been moved to the cloud, while some are still available internally. Therefore, special attention should be paid to ensure the normal operation of the current system and the correct process of cloud migration.
4.  Interoperability becomes a problem because it is not easy to establish perfect communication between existing applications and newer cloud environments.
5.  The use of cloud services, skilled use of updated cloud programs, management of resources and cloud activities require well-trained IT professionals who can work in the cloud ecosystem.
