[增量过程模型](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-incremental-process-model/)也称为逐次版本模型。这个模型需求被分解成软件开发周期的多个独立模块。第一个增量是基本需求的核心产品，下一个增量是补充功能。许多连续的迭代/版本被实现并交付给客户，直到期望的系统被发布。

**使用增量流程模型的优势:**

1.  Due to the use of divide-and-conquer approximation, it is easy to decompose tasks.
2.  The initial delivery cost is reduced.
3.  There is incremental resource deployment.
4.  Because the core module is used by customers from the beginning of the stage, and then 5, it is easy to deduct errors. These have been thoroughly tested.
5.  Know the demand in advance and use it well.
6.  When the project has a lengthy development schedule, it is good to use it.
7.  It is good to use new technology when the project uses it.
8.  It is very good to use it when the capital plan, risk, plan complexity or need to realize the benefits as soon as possible.
9.  It quickly generates working software in the early stage of the software life cycle.
10.  The scope and requirements of change are more flexible and the cost is lower.
11.  It is easy to manage each iteration.
12.  Because iteration is easy to manage risks.

**使用增量过程模型的缺点:**

1.  It needs a good planning and design.
2.  More expensive than the waterfall model.
3.  The system definition should be complete and clear.
