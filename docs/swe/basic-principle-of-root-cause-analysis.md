**根本原因分析(RCA)** 是主要的问题解决技巧之一。它主要帮助组织提高[软件质量](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-quality/)，通过减少系统中的缺陷数量来导致组织的改进。这是一个识别问题或缺陷的主要原因(根本原因)的系统过程，也是解决问题或缺陷的有效方法。消除缺陷的主要原因，从而减少缺陷的再次发生。这是需要 RCA 概念和工具的地方，非常有用。这项技术在以下方面有所帮助:

*   It improves the reliability.
*   Constantly challenge costly defects and problems.
*   Prevent defects from happening again in the future.
*   And monitor and maximize the return on business investment.

**RCA 的基本原则:**

1.  The main purpose of RCA is to determine the main cause of the problem, and then identify and take corrective measures and actions that can help eliminate the main cause of the defect. Therefore, we can prevent defects from appearing again in the future.
2.  One should be very focused on determining and identifying the corrective measures to be taken to obtain better and effective results, rather than simply dealing with the symptoms of system defects.
3.  The investigation process is a very necessary and critical process. To achieve successful and correct results, proper procedures need to be followed. Similarly, in order to achieve better results, people should conduct resident coordinator assessment in a very effective way, pay full attention to and follow the procedures.
4.  We know that there is always a reason or cause for things to happen or happen. Defects don't happen for no reason. There are some mistakes in process, system and demand. Cause defects to occur. Therefore, people need to understand that for each defect, at least one root cause leads to the occurrence of a specific defect. Yes, there may be some difficulties in finding it, but one should go all out and have enough energy to identify it.
5.  In order to better understand the relationship among contributing factors, main causes and defined defects, analysis needs to develop a series of timelines or events.
6.  The main concern should be why there are defects, what are the main causes of defects, rather than who made mistakes. The focus should be on how and why the defect happened, not who should be responsible.
7.  Yes, symptoms are so important that they should be treated equally, but it is not correct to focus only on symptoms. One should focus on finding the right way to solve defects, not just on symptoms.
