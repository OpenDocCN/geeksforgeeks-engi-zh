# 在 DMP 发现的缺陷类型

> 原文:[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-of-defects-found-in-dmp/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-of-defects-found-in-dmp/)

在[缺陷管理过程(DMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stages-of-defect-management-process/) 中，不同类型的缺陷由测试人员识别。在[软件开发生命周期](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/)的不同阶段，可能会出现不同的缺陷。在早期阶段识别缺陷非常重要。它帮助和支持 DMP 的改进，降低成本费用，最大限度地减少系统缺陷。

**缺陷类型:**

1.  **Defects caused by human beings:**
    *   Lack of knowledge is one of the main causes of defects. Knowledge about products or applications is very necessary for better understanding and use. Therefore, people should know the applicability before using it.
    *   Some people tend to ignore things that may lead to the nature of defects. Therefore, everything should be considered emphatically.
    *   Lack of information about the process is also the main cause of the defect. One should have all the detailed information about the system process.
2.  **Defects caused by translation:**
    *   Nowadays, it is very important to better understand the requirements. The development team should properly communicate with customers, customers and end users. Understand the requirements carefully. Poor communication is one of the main causes of defects.
    *   The software development results should meet the requirements, that is, the requirements of customers or customers should be met. If the finished product does not meet the requirements, it will be useless.
    *   Software requirements should be matched with test cases. If there is any mismatch, it may lead to defects. Therefore, it is very important to first comprehensively check and analyze the requirements and then make a decision.
3.  **Defects due to design and coding:**
    *   Part of the data is integrated with consistency and accuracy in SDLC. But if someone modifies the data, it may cause defects.
    *   Some data are stored correctly in the database. However, if someone makes a small mistake when changing the data, there may be defects.
    *   For better test results, the design code should be written well and correctly. If there are some errors or incorrect constructions in the code, it may affect the test results.
4.  **Defect caused by test:**
    *   Humans are prone to make mistakes, so it's no big deal. But efforts should be made to focus on everything. While performing tests, testers need to focus on everything in order to identify problems or defects (if any). If the tester doesn't concentrate, some problems may go unnoticed and cause greater damage to the system.
    *   Failure to perform planned tests is also the main cause of defects.
