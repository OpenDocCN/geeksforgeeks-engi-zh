**安全系统开发生命周期(SecSDLC)** 定义为在[软件开发周期(SDLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-sdlc-v-model/) 中按顺序执行的一组程序。它的设计可以帮助开发人员创建软件和应用程序，从一开始就大大降低后期的安全风险。

安全系统开发生命周期(SecSDLC)与软件开发生命周期(SDLC)有些相同，但它们在周期的每个阶段执行的活动方面有所不同。SecSDLC 消除了安全漏洞，其流程包括识别某些威胁和这些威胁在系统上代表的风险，以及实施必要的安全控制来应对、消除和管理相关风险。而在软件开发生命周期过程中，重点主要是信息系统的设计和实现。

**SecSDLC 涉及的相位为:**

*   **系统调查:**
    该流程由在组织最高管理层工作的官员/指令启动。为了执行这个过程，项目的目标和目的被优先考虑。定义了一个信息安全策略，它包含了安全应用程序和程序的描述，以及它们在组织系统中的实现。

*   **System Analysis:**
    In this phase detailed document analysis of the documents from the System Investigation phase are done. Already existing security policies, applications and software are analysed in order to check for different flaws and vulnerabilities in the system. Upcoming threat possibilities are also analyzed. Risk management comes under this process only.*   **Logical Design:**
    The Logical Design phase deal with the development of tools and the following blueprints that are involved in various information security policies their applications and software. Backup and recovery policies are also drafted in order to prevent future losses. In case of any disaster the steps to take in business are also planned. The decision for outsourcing the company project is decided in this phase. It is analyzed whether the project can be completed in the company itself or it needs to be sent to another company for the specific task.*   **Physical Design:**
    The technical teams acquires the tools and blueprints needed for the implementation of the software and application of the system security. During this phase different solutions are investigated for any unforeseen issues which may be encountered in the future, they are analysed and written down in order to cover the most of the vulnerabilities that were missed during the analysis phase.*   **Implementation:**
    The solution decided in earlier phases are made final whether the project being in-house or outsource the proper documentation are provided of the product in order to meet the requirements specified for the project to be met. Implementation and the integration process of the project are carried out with the help of various teams aggressively testing whether the product meets the system requirements specified in the system documentations.*   **Maintenance:**
    After the implementation of the security program it must be insured that it is functioning properly and is managed accordingly. The security program must be kept up to date accordingly in order to counter new threats that can be left unseen at the time of design.

    这些是 SecSDLC 周期中涉及的步骤及其简要描述。
