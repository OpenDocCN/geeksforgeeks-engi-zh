# 软件开发中管理依赖的因素

在软件开发中，管理生产力的任务是关键问题。软件开发的管理严重依赖于四个因素:

1.  **People –**
    When we refer to people in software development, we actually mean hierarchy of roles in software development such as managers, team leaders, senior developers etc. They are ones who form development team and work in development of software. The order of priority of people among other dependency factors is **first** (highest). Software development is people-centric activity.
    Software development requires good managers, people who understand psychology of people and provide good leadership.

    一个好的管理者并不能保证项目的成功，但可以增加成功的概率。一个好的经理会优先考虑适当的选择、培训、薪酬、职业发展、工作文化、发展团队的效率等方面。

    因此，经理对于软件开发来说是至关重要的，他们有责任管理、激励、鼓励、控制和指导他/她的开发团队度过难关。因此，项目的成功取决于参与开发的人。

2.  **Product –**
    A product is solution of problem that is handed to user who is struggling with problem. The priority of product among other dependency factors is **second** that is after **people**. The product or solution to problem is constructed based on requirements, which are objectives and scope work of problem. This helps managers to select best approach within constraints imposed by delivery deadlines, budgetary restrictions, personnel availability, technical interfaces etc. Without well defined requirements, it may be impossible to define reasonable estimates of cost, development time and schedule for project.
3.  **Process –**
    The process is way in which we produce software. It provides framework from which comprehensive plan for software development can be established. If process is weak, end product will undoubtedly suffer. The priority of process among other dependency factors is **third**, after **people** and **product**, however, it plays very critical role for success of project. There are many life cycle models and process improvements models. A suitable process model is determined on basis of requirements specification, development team, user, type of project and associated risks of project.

    许多不同的任务集、里程碑、工作产品和质量保证点，使过程框架活动能够适应项目的特点和项目团队的要求。

4.  **项目–**
    需要适当的规划来监控开发状态并控制复杂性。要使项目成功，它应该在预算范围内，遵循规定的政策和要求，并在规定的时间内完成。大多数项目超出预算 100%的成本，没有按时交付。项目在其他依赖因素中的优先级是**最后**(最低)。为了管理成功的项目，我们必须了解和预防相关的风险。只要有可能，就应该定义和冻结具体要求。不应该进行不必要的更改来避免软件意外。软件惊喜总是有风险的，应该最小化。应该建立一个计划机制来防止任何意外的发生。

人、产品、过程和项目这四个因素对项目的成功都很重要。它们的相对重要性帮助我们以更加科学和专业的方式组织发展活动。
