使用 [CASE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-aided-software-engineering-case/) 设置或单独的 CASE 工具会带来一些好处。其中一些好处是:

*   A key profit generated by using the CASE environment is to save value in all development stages. Completely different studies to understand the impact of cases have reduced the problem by 30% to 40%.
*   The use of CASE tools has brought about a good improvement in quality. This is mainly due to the fact that people can retell all stages of code development effortlessly, so the possibility of human error is greatly reduced.
*   CASE tools help to make high-quality and consistent documents. Because the necessary information related to commodities is stored in a very centralized repository, the redundancy in the stored information is reduced, so the possibility of inconsistent documents is well reduced.
*   CASE confiscated most of the labor of an extreme code engineer. For example, they don't have to check the level of DFD carefully, but they can do it effortlessly by pressing a button.
*   CASE has crystal rectifier, which can realize revolutionary value saving in code maintenance. This is not only because of the great value of CASE settings in traceability and consistency check, but also because of the system information capture in every stage of code development caused by following CASE settings.
*   The introduction of CASE has an impact on the organization's operational design and makes it oriented to a structured and orderly method.
