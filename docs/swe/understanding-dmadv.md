**DMADV ：**

DMADV 是一个被定义为摩托罗拉的过程，其中包括六西格玛管理哲学。该术语代表定义、测量、分析、设计、验证它们在特定的有序过程中工作。DMADV 是杂类，属于未分类的子类。

这些包括六西格玛工作与极其雄心勃勃的目标，以尽量减少产品和服务中出现的缺陷。将制造过程中的改进与管理客户服务的改进结合起来，有助于在市场上提供更完整、更有利可图的产品。

**让我们总结一下六西格玛规则:**

1.  **Definition:** It states the problem, designates the customer, determines the target, and completes the target outline process. This is the first basic stage of the framework, in which targets are assigned and identified. Realistic and measurable are set by companies and stakeholders. After defining the concept, the project strategy is adjusted according to the customer.
2.  **Measurement:** It determines the parameters according to the quantity, works in the best measurement mode, collects data and carries out experiments. The key factors are considered and the demand measure is defined in such a way that it can evaluate the quality, process, capability and all possible risk factors.
3.  **Analysis:** Determine the performance target and the input process that affects the output process. It is close to developing design alternatives, defining better combination of requirements to realize value within several constraints, designing and finally finding the best product.
4.  **Design:** It works on details, giving priority to advanced design, optimizing prototype model, detecting errors and running simulation. It handles advanced design, develops more detailed design and more high-function prototypes.
5.  **Verification:** Expectation is confirmed, deployment is expanded, experience is confirmed, and try. The final stage of the team is to verify the design and make it meet the requirements and acceptable. This is also an important step in the whole plan, which stipulates the transition from process to normal operation.

这些步骤仔细检查现有的过程，因此被称为西格玛，它不符合六西格玛要求。所有这些西格玛过程都是由六西格玛执行的。

它定义了与服务或产品相关的客户需求。另一方面，它测量客户的规格和需求。DMADV 开发了一个合适的商业模式来满足客户的要求

**策略 DMADV 遵循:**

*   Make efficiency and effectiveness
*   Non-interchangeable design
*   Improve Six Sigma Rules according to customer needs and services
*   priority
*   According to the product service analysis and evaluation process design
*   Check results and maintain performance.

**DMADV 优势:**

1.  Maximize customer satisfaction.

2.  Minimize the defect rate.

**DMADV 的劣势:**

1.  Training employees in Six Sigma is time-consuming and sometimes low cost.
2.  Priority is given to innovation, and creativity is the main disadvantage.
