# 软件测试的神话

在[软件测试](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/)的周围，有许多神话和错误的假设继续隐现。还有很多神话阻碍了软件应用程序的全面测试，这可能会导致软件应用程序不安全，效率低下。软件测试不仅为系统或软件应用程序提供安全性，还专注于满足最终用户的需求。

以下是为了良好的软件质量需要挑战的误区:

*   **Testing expenditure is unnecessary:** 
    Often people think that too much money expenditure on testing is unworthy but the reality is that if testing is done in a proper way then there will be a lot more savings on the further maintenance of the software. Repeatedly software maintenance cost is a lot more than one-time testing cost. 
*   **Testing takes** a **lot** of **time:** 
    It is often a talk around that testing consumes a lot of time but the fact is that testing is not a time-consuming process. Although debugging takes more time as fixing the bugs are complicated. 
*   **Perfect Testing is possible:** 
    Often a client thinks that if the software application is tested then it a perfect product but the fact is something else. There might exist some vulnerabilities that can’t be executed during the testing process and it creates problems once the product is launched. 
*   **Only completely developed products are tested:** 
    It is always a consideration that once the software product is fully developed only then it is tested. But the fact is that after each functionality addition or removal software product is tested. If testing is carried out only after full development it might create chaos and may take a lot of effort to fix it. 
*   **Tested software** defects **less:** 
    Software can’t be 100% defect less even after thousands of testing processes. Often the clients and also developers think that if the software is tested in multiple levels then it has zero bugs but it is only a myth while the fact is a software can’t be 100% defectless. 
*   **Automation testing consumes less time:** 
    It is true that automation testing consumes less time but automation testing can’t be performed at every stage of the software development and also automation testing is only performed after the manual testing. There are also some testing which is only performed only in a manual way. 
*   **Software testing is** a **cakewalk:** 
    Often people outside the testing team think that testing can be done by a person with less experience and less knowledge. The reality is that testing is done by testing experts that are experienced and knowledge full personnel in order to get productive software. 
*   **测试就是寻找 bug:**
    的确，寻找 bug 是测试的突出目标之一，但它不是唯一的目标。除了发现缺陷之外，在测试过程中还有几个方面需要检查。在测试过程中检查软件功能和非功能需求。
