在早期，迭代瀑布模型在完成一个项目时非常流行。但是现在开发人员在使用它开发软件时面临着各种各样的问题。主要困难包括在项目开发期间处理客户的变更请求，以及合并这些变更所需的高成本和时间。为了克服瀑布模型的这些缺点，在 20 世纪 90 年代中期，敏捷软件开发模型被提出。

敏捷模型主要是为了帮助项目快速适应变更请求。因此，敏捷模型的主要目的是促进项目快速完成。要完成这项任务，需要敏捷性。敏捷性是通过将过程与项目相适应，删除对特定项目来说不重要的活动来实现的。此外，任何浪费时间和精力的事情都可以避免。

实际上敏捷模型指的是一组开发过程。这些过程有一些共同的基本特征，但它们之间确实有一些微妙的差异。下面给出了几个敏捷 SDLC 模型:

*   [Crystal]

*   Function-driven development
*   混乱
*   Extreme programming (XP)
*   Lean development
*   Unified process

在敏捷模型中，需求被分解成许多可以增量开发的小部分。敏捷模型采用迭代开发。每个增量部分都是通过迭代开发的。每一次迭代都是小的，易于管理的，并且只能在几周内完成。一次为客户规划、开发和部署一次迭代。没有制定长期计划。

敏捷模型是迭代和增量过程模型的结合。敏捷 SDLC 模型涉及的步骤有:

*   Demand collection
*   Demand analysis
*   design
*   encode
*   unit testing
*   acceptance testing

完成迭代的时间被称为时间盒。时间盒是指向客户交付迭代所需的最长时间。因此，迭代的结束日期不会改变。尽管开发团队可以决定在时间盒期间减少交付的功能，如果有必要的话，按时交付。敏捷模型的核心原则是在每个时间框之后向客户交付增量。

**敏捷模型的原则:**

*   In order to establish close contact with customers in the development process and have a clear understanding of various requirements, each agile project usually includes a customer representative in the team. At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and customer representatives review the progress made and reassess the requirements.
*   Agile models depend on the deployment of working software, not comprehensive documentation.
*   Frequent delivery of incremental versions of software to customer representatives every few weeks.
*   And encourage the effective integration of customer demand change requests.
*   It is more important to have efficient team members and strengthen communication among team members. People realize that enhanced communication among development team members can be achieved through face-to-face communication, rather than through the exchange of formal documents.
*   It is suggested that the development team should be kept small (5-9 people) to help team members have meaningful face-to-face communication and have a collaborative working environment.
*   Agile development processes usually deploy Pair Programming. In pair programming, two programmers work together at a workstation. One person codes, while the other person checks the code when entering it. The two programmers exchange roles once every hour or so.

**优势:**

*   Pair programming produces well-written compact programs, which have fewer errors than programmers working alone.
*   The total development time of the whole project is reduced.
*   After each iteration, the customer representative will get the idea of updating the software product. Therefore, if necessary, he can easily change any requirement.

**缺点:**

*   Due to the lack of formal documents, leading to confusion, important decisions made at different stages may be misinterpreted by different team members at any time.
*   Due to the lack of proper documentation, when the project is completed and the developer is assigned to another project, the maintenance of the development project will become a problem.
