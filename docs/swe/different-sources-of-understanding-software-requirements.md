软件的需求规格说明为开发系统提供了基础，这是 [SDLC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/) 中最关键的步骤之一。虽然涉众是需求的最终来源，但是您不能依赖于单一来源所陈述的规范。

对于单一来源的需求，几乎不可能对规范进行验证，因为不会对来自各种来源的规定专业进行可比检查，这些来源包括客户、消费者、问题领域专家、关联领域专家、潜在用户、运营商、经验丰富的开发人员，甚至系统的批评者。一组知识数据产生于现有的手动或半自动系统的执行。

来自所有者、用户、操作员和其他工人的反馈。受益者也被收集起来，他们对新系统的建议和期望被记录下来。收集的数据经过集体评估和提炼，并与相关人员协商。
