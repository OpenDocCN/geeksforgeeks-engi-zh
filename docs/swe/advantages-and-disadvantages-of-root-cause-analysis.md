**[【根本原因分析(RCA)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-principle-of-root-cause-analysis/)** ，顾名思义，就是分析系统内部缺陷主要原因的过程。它是识别导致缺陷发生的主要活动或过程的过程，这些缺陷导致不希望的结果并采取纠正措施。在确定主要原因后，通过采取一些必要的措施和行动，找到或确定不同的方法来消除或消除或减少其影响。根本原因分析的重要性它允许采取必要的措施和行动来解决缺陷，以便这些缺陷不会在将来再次发生。它基本上提供了各种方法来确定和识别过程和系统中导致缺陷的故障，以及如何防止缺陷的未来发生。其要点如下:

*   Improve software quality by minimizing the total number of defects.
*   To identify defects, using professional knowledge is very effective-sufficient and important.

要进行**根本原因分析(RCA)** ，需要非常专注和努力。因此，需要专注的团队来执行 RCA。团队可能包括研究人员、卫生人员、社会工作人员和沟通人员(如果有的话)。它应该作为情况分析的一部分进行。RCA 是一种专注于识别缺陷的真正原因并加以处理的技术。这个过程基本上帮助涉众足够好地了解和理解缺陷的主要原因，从而实现缺陷的永久解决。

**优势:**

1.  RCA usually helps to identify and identify defects and the main causes of defects. By identifying the root cause, a permanent solution can be found, thus reducing or eliminating the possibility of its recurrence.
2.  It helps to develop logical methods to solve problems. After determining the main causes of defects, people will try to find out and find out the main solutions to the problems with the help of existing information.
3.  Once the defects are identified, we can identify all the changes needed for software quality improvement. We can identify the current needs and the future needs of organization and system improvement.
4.  It also helps to establish repeatable and appropriate step-by-step processes, in which one process may confirm the results of the other process.
5.  Used to analyze different activities of the organization, such as:
    *   Analytical quality control
    *   Failure in analysis and maintenance
    *   The flow of analysis system
    *   Analyze different system-based processes.
    *   Analyze risk and change management

**缺点:**

1.  The main problem of RCA is that it only presupposes one premise, that is, it only assumes and pays attention to one root cause of defects. But in reality, the situation may be more complicated. There may be more than one root cause of the defect. Therefore, one needs to pay attention to all aspects related to defects and consider all the root causes of defects.
2.  Organizations only use RCA to identify negative things that are happening in the organization. RCA can also be used to identify good things that are happening in the organization. RCA technology used to identify the root cause of defects can also be used to identify why some processes perform very well in an excellent way. Identifying positive aspects gives another opportunity for continuous improvement.
