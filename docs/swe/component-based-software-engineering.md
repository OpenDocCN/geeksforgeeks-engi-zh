**基于组件的软件工程(CBSE)** 是一个使用可重用软件组件，专注于基于计算机的系统的设计和开发的过程。

**基于组件的软件工程的 CBSE 框架活动**
框架活动如下:-

1.  **Component Qualification:**
    This activity ensures that the system architecture define the requirements of the components for becoming a reusable component.Reusable components are generally identified through the traits in their interfaces. It means “the services that are given, and the means by which customers or consumers access these services ” are defined as a part of the component interface.
2.  **Component Adaptation:**
    This activity ensures that the architecture defines the design conditions for all component and identifying their modes of connection. In some of the cases, existing reusable components may not be allowed to get used due to the architecture’s design rules and conditions. These components should adapt and meet the requirements of the architecture or refused and replaced by other, more suitable components.
3.  **Component Composition:**
    This activity ensures that the Architectural style of the system integrates the software components and form a working system. By identifying connection and coordination mechanisms of the system, the architecture describes the composition of the end product.
4.  **组件更新:**
    该活动确保可重用组件的更新。有时，由于包含第三方(开发可重用组件的组织可能不在当前访问组件的软件工程组织的直接控制之内)，更新变得复杂。).
