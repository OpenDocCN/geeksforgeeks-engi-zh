如上给出的排序链表，其中每个节点有 2 个向左和向下的指针。每一行的起始节点向下指向下一行的起始节点。每行有 4 个元素，除了最后一行可以有< = 4 个元素。下一行开始元素大于前一行结束元素。我们需要为它设计和编码在正确的地方插入新的值和删除操作。8 人进入下一轮。

**第 2 轮:**

1.  What is memory level?
2.  The difference between virtual memory and physical memory?
3.  How does caching work?
4.  If the value is not found, what are the different algorithms for inserting the value into the cache?
5.  Threads access the same variable at the same time. How are they assigned at the processor level?
6.  LRU algorithm based on cache. I did it in o (cache size). Look forward to a better way.
7.  Write hash function from scratch. Even if the keywords are integers, strings, etc. Handle in time. Use as little memory as possible to map to values.

**第 3 轮:**

1.  Implement billing design in the cloud. Any third party can use it and implement the billing system there.
2.  Write Singleton class implementation.
3.  Inventory time problem. Give the stock according to the time. We need to know when we can buy stocks. So we will never lose, and write all the test cases for it.
4.  Implement post-order traversal.
5.  Why Microsoft? Four people were selected into the management group.

**管理:**

1.  What happens when we click the+button in chrome and the new tab opens.
2.  When the source and destination pointers are given, memcopy is implemented from scratch in C language. The size of the source is also given. I use it to loop and dereference replication. If the target pointer is in the source block we are copying, forget to implement the corner example. Was rejected.
